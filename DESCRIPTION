Description: 
    This package implements DrFARM, a method initially developed for identifying 
    pleiotropic variants in multi-outcome GWAS analysis but is also applicable 
    for generic "master predictor"" identification when non-genetic data are used 
    for the design matrix. A sparse group-lasso penalty is used to encourage 
    master predictor (i.e., pleiotropic variant) identification. Instead of assuming 
    independent errors as in typical multivariate (multi-outcome) regression, 
    DrFARM imposes a factor analysis model on the residual, allowing a better 
    fit. Entrywise p-values are obtained via outer-debiasing, and group-level 
    p-values are obtained using a Cauchy combination test. This package 
    supports initial value estimation via remMap, precision matrix estimation 
    (needed for DrFARM), and statistical inference.
